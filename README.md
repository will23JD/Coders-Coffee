## Agile
In this project I used agile works flows to help keep on track and understand where my project is in the development cycle.

### Kanban Board and Issues

Github Issues were used to create user stories which where placed into a [backlog](https://github.com/will23JD/Coders-Coffee/milestone/1). and added to a [project](https://github.com/users/will23JD/projects/2).
I used the Kanban board colums Todo, In progress and Done to keep track of user stories as I moved through the project. This kept me on track through the
cycle of development.

## Website Structure

### Site Map
